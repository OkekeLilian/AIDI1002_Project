#  A Comparative Study for Time-to-Event Analysis and Survival Prediction for Heart Failure Condition using Machine Learning Techniques
## Introduction
 Heart failure is a critical condition where the heart fails to pump blood efficiently, leading to a shortage of oxygen and nutrients in body tissues. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for approximately 17.9 million deaths globally each year, making it a leading cause of mortality. This project focuses on analyzing survival rates and predicting outcomes for patients with advanced heart failure using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop predictive models that can provide accurate survival predictions and risk assessments, thereby improving patient care through more precise and personalized treatment strategies  

 ## Project Aim
The primary aim of this project is to conduct an in-depth survival analysis and create predictive models for heart failure patients using machine learning techniques. This involves analyzing clinical data from patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and developing models using various algorithms to forecast survival outcomes.

## Project Structure
###### Data : Folder containing the dataset used for analysis
###### Code :Folder containing all scripts and Jupyter notebooks
###### Requirements.txt : List of dependencies required to run the project
###### README.md : Project overview and instructions

## Installation
#### To run this project, follow the steps below:
##### Clone the repository: 
you can use this following command in your terminal or command prompt 'git clone https://github.com/OkekeLilian/AIDI1002_Project'

## Usage
To execute the project, open the Final_Project.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment. Change the dataset path to match where you saved the dataset, and also update the path to where you saved ReusableUtils.py. Then, run the cells sequentially. This will load the dataset, perform data preprocessing, train various machine learning models, and evaluate their performance
